Tartarus: init script for Erlang applications
=============================================

Based on the "Embedded Solaris" chapter in the Erlang/OTP Embedded Systems
User's Guide. I'm not an Erlang expert, so suggestions are welcome!

Installing
----------

* [optional] Add hostnames to "hosts.erlang". This file gets installed in
$TARTARUS_HOME as ".hosts.erlang".

* Edit "erlang.cookie". This file gets installed in $TARTARUS_HOME as
".erlang.cookie", and is the mechanism for authenticating distributed Erlang
nodes.

* Edit the "config" file. See the file for instructions. Note that any changes
to $TARTARUS_USER, $TARTARUS_HOME, or $TARTARUS_LOG_DIR must be done before
the next step.

* Run `sudo ./install.sh`.
